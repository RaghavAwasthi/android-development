Project Domain: Health 
Project Name: StayHealthy

Problem: With our busy lives, we somehow end up giving health a less priority. We fail to keep our reports, our health history organized. We forget to track the most important parameters related to health like our weight, BMI, Blood pressure and many more.

Proposed Solution: We are proposing to provide a platform where we can track all the important parameters for health. It will make it easy if you have a platform where you can directly add your reports ana many more things by just a click.Main features we are planning to cover are:
1. Trackers : Weight, BP (Focus will be given to UI)
2. Profile: With patient history, reports (Database implementation)
3. Doctors details (Recyclerview, Using API and json parsing)
